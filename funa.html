                FUNA is an exploration of sound as a living, medium, where memory, desire, and ecological intensities converge. 
                The project inhabits what Rei calls the “absolute after”—an open and persistent terrain shaped by collapse, where absence and residue assert their own presence. 
                Each work unfolds as erosion or renewal, attending to what survives while allowing unfamiliar forms to emerge. Rather than looking to fixed genealogies, 
                FUNA draws from the layered strata of collective wound, ritual gesture, and ancestral atmospheres that linger across bodies and territories. 
                Through granular synthesis, spectral processing, and EVP field recordings, the project transforms silenced systems into resonance, embracing loops and glitches as compositional matter. 
                Listening becomes an embodied encounter with persistence, decay, and the subtle transformations that arise in the aftermath of disappearance.
