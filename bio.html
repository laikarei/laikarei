                Born in Chile and currently based in Southern Italy’s Salento region,
                Laika Rei develops a transdisciplinary practice that moves between sound,
                performance, and dance. His work traces how vibration, movement, and distance
                weave together to create perceptual spaces where listening becomes both a sensory
                and existential act. Through the modulation of space, feedback, and distance,
                he explores sound as a material of relation—a force capable of linking bodies,
                architectures, and memories beyond linguistic form.

            <p>
                Guided by a Latin American sensitivity to the affective and ancestral,
                Rei approaches sound as a living continuum between presence and disappearance.
                His compositions and performances arise from encounters with landscapes, gestures,
                and remnants—what resists capture yet insists on being felt. This orientation
                toward the invisible and the residual reflects an ongoing search for modes
                of listening that hold the political and the poetic in tension, situating vibration
                as a site of both remembrance and transformation.

            <p>
                Across residencies, festivals, and collaborative frameworks in Chile and Europe,
                he has developed works with choreographers, performers, and visual artists that
                expand sound into the realm of gesture and spatial composition. These exchanges
                have shaped an approach that privileges process over form, cultivating sonic
                environments that unfold as porous rituals—spaces where the boundaries between the
                human and the nonhuman, the intimate and the architectural, are constantly being rewritten.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Through his ongoing project FUNA, Laika deepens this inquiry into collapse,
                desire, and spectral ecology, articulating a sonic mythology in which listening
                becomes an act of invocation, care, and release. His practice thus emerges as
                a curatorial exploration of resonance as a mode of coexistence—a way of sensing
                the world that is at once material, emotional, and profoundly relational.
